### Week 0

Choose a programming language based on Google’s expectations and your preferences.

### Week 1

Review the basics of your programming language. If you brush up on the basics, you’re less likely to stumble during your interview. Review concepts like how to read input from the console, and how to declare and use 2D arrays.

### Week 2 & 3

Familiarize yourself with data structures and algorithms. These are essential to coding interviews with Google.
__Data structures you should know:__
**Arrays
Linked lists
Stacks
Queues
Trees
Graphs
Heaps
Hash sets
Hash maps/tables
Algorithms you should know:
Breadth-first search
Depth-first search
Binary search
Quicksort
Mergesort
$ A^* $
Dynamic programming
Divide and conquer​**

### Week 4 & 5

Practice data structure and algorithmic challenges with sites like Educative or Leetcode. Start practicing simple coding problems. This will make it easier down the line to tackle harder questions.

### Weeks 6–8

Practice complex coding problems, and start timing yourself. It’s important to consider runtime and memory complexity for each solution.

### Weeks 9 & 10

Study system design interview questions. These are now an integral part of the interview process and impact your hiring level.

### Week 11

Study OS and concurrency concepts. These questions are used to gauge your hiring level. Brush up on multithreading fundamentals to stand out for higher levels in Google’s ladder.

### Week 12

Study object-oriented programming and design questions. These questions gauge your critical thinking, project-based problem-solving skills.

## Tips for practicing coding challenges

There is no shortcut or magic wand for practicing coding challenges. Here are some basic tips to guide you through the preparation stage.

### Keep time in mind.

The coding interview will be timed, so it’s important to prepare with that in mind. If you are used to preparing under a time constraint, it will be far less stressful during the actual interview.

### Know your weak spots.

As you prepare, take note of your weak spots. Everyone has them. Google has stated that they care about your thought process, so if you come up against a weak spot, talk through it. This will demonstrate your eagerness to improve.

### Know the common pitfalls

There are three big pitfalls when it comes to a Google interview: not knowing the Big-O complexity of an algorithm, having no knowledge of Google’s expectations, and not articulating your problem-solving process. Keep these pitfalls in mind as you work.

### Articulate your process

Google wants to hear about your thought process. As you practice, get used to explaining why and what you are doing. Those with a clear sense of how they work stand out.
